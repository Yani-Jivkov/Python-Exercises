## Installation
To run these exercises, you'll need:

- A computer (preferably not from the 90s)

- An internet connection (to Google why your code isn't working)

- A strong sense of humor (for when you realize your code is actually just a dumpster fire)

## Usage

1.Clone this repository to your local machine.

2.Open your favorite code editor. If you don't have one, may I suggest PyCharm?

3.Browse through the exercises and pick one that piques your interest.

4.Attempt to solve the exercise. Bonus points for creative solutions!

5.Scratch your head, curse the Python gods, and finally, Google the solution.

6.Repeat steps 3-5 until you either master Python or decide to become a goat farmer in the Alps.

## Contributing
Found a bug in my exercises? Great! Open an issue and let's argue about whether it's a bug or a feature. Want to contribute your own exercises? Fantastic! Just remember, if your code doesn't make someone question their life choices, you're doing it wrong.
